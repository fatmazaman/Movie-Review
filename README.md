### Concept
   > __Class__: A class is a blueprint or factory that describe the nature of something.Also defines the characteristics of a thing (attributes).

   > __Self__: self refers to the newly created object; in other class methods, it refers to the instance whose method was called.self is not a python keyword. We made a mistake in calling it so. If you change all occurrences of the word **self** to another word, say "udacity" the code will still work.
   ```Even though self is not a keyword, it is a convention that is used by most Python programmers. Using the word self will make your code more readable to other programmers```

   > __Instance__: An instance is a specific realization of any object. An object may be varied in a number of ways. Each realized variation of that object is an __instance__. The creation of a realized **instance** is called instantiation. Each time a program runs, it is an __instance__ of that program

   > __Construstor__: A constructor (abbreviation: ctor) in a class is a special type of subroutine called to create an object.
    **Doubt:** The python constructor is --new-- , and --init-- is an initialiser (what the difference between init and new)
   ```The constructor is always written as a function called __init__(). It must always take as its first argument a reference to the instance being constructed. ```

   > __Instance Variable__: An instance variable is a variable defined in a class, for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance.

   > __Instance Method__:The methods (that is, subroutines) that the object contains are called instance methods.

### Advance Concept   
   > __Class Variable__: A class variable is a variable defined in a class of which a single copy exists, regardless of how many instances of the class exist.

   > [__Pre Define Class variable__](http://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/courses/python/class/5/): --doc--, --name--, --module--, --init-- etc.

   > __Inheritance__: Of course, Python supports inheritance, it even supports multiple inheritance. Classes can inherit from other classes. A class can inherit attributes and behavior methods from another class, called the superclass. A class which inherits from a superclass is called a subclass, also called heir class or child class.

   > __Method Overriding__: Method overriding, in object oriented programming, is a language feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes.

  ``` FYI:Function overloading is absent in Python```
